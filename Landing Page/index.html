                <p class = "aboutMe">
                    I've just finished my second year studying Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Virginia.
                    I only just got into CS last year, although have found it to be more and more interesting as I've delved further 
                    into the subject. I'm proficcient in Java, but pretty rusty in Python. I also know R, C,  a little SQL, 
                    and Assemblyx86-64. I'm excited to gain profeciency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my time in Cape Town.
                <p class = "aboutMe">
                    I started going to the gym in highschool because of sports and have been no where close to as consistent 
                    as I was before, although I do enjoy working out as a stress-reliever and consider myself semi-active. My music taste
                    ranges although I'd say my favorite artist by far is Mac Miller, followed by SZA, Frank Ocean, and Kendrick Lamar. When
                    I'm not stressed at my computer debugging a programming assignment, I enjoy going on (moderate) hikes in nature and
                    sitting on park benches.
